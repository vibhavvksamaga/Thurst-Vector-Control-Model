# Thurst-Vector-Control-And-Flight-Computer-Model
This project involves a functional TVC Mount/Model for Rocket Engines.
Primarily It consists of three 3D printed parts that serve as the mount for your Rocket Engine and is controlled by the Flight Computer.
The flight computer mainly is composed of a ESP32, RED LED(for power indication), BMP180 Sensor, NEO-6M GPS Module and the MPU6050 GYRO-ACC Sensor.
The flight computer captures data like the Location of the Flight Computer for tracking, The temperature, pressure and altitude. All this ,ultimately, gets inputed onto an excel sheet on the go for logging in the data.
The 3d Models and CODE are also attatched to the repository.
